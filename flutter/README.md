# Getting Started with Flutter

This template creates a starter project for a Flutter application.

## Files

* `dev.nix`: This file configures the development environment using Nix. It specifies the necessary packages, environment variables, and VS Code extensions for Flutter development.
* `idx-template.nix`: This file is used by Project IDX to define the project structure and dependencies.
* `idx-template.json`: This file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, description, and categories.

## Naming Convention

The name should consist of lowercase words separated by underscores, "like_this". Use only basic Latin letters and Arabic digits: [a-z0-9_], and ensure the name is a valid Dart identifier (i.e. it does not start with a digit and is not a reserved word).

See https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#name for more information.
